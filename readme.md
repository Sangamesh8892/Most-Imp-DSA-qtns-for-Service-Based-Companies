📘 DSA Practice (Java)

This repository contains basic Data Structures and Algorithms questions implemented in Java, commonly asked in MNC company exams and interviews such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, etc.

The focus is on fundamental problem-solving, clear logic, and interview-oriented questions, making it useful for freshers preparing for written tests and technical rounds.

This repo is also part of my consistent DSA practice while preparing for similar MNC interviews.
